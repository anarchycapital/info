Information about the group

Anarchy Capital Group is a private organization anonymously funding disrupting projects. Its members are going by acronyms and aliases. 

The Group was founded officially on april 9th 2012 by "ZEI" who used to be a white hat security programmer for more than 20 years and a crypto investor since 2013. 

Anarchy Capital goes against the flow. However we stand by some internal rules. 

- Always act with class, freedom is not achieved by insulting people.
- Integrity first.
- Never disclose the identity of other members to anyone.
- Never dox online people, we are not in this business.
- Always provide the hungry unicorns with means to achieve their goals.
- Do only good every day. 

We have secure communication channels online that we communicate trough. If you are to be part of this group you will find them. 

Thank you, and remember virtux est audax (to the courageous the world will belong) 

ZEI
